== Programming with `yStr`

=== Immutable Strings

Since we hardly deal with unicode characters in biological texts, all strings are represented as `byte[]`. Using such could reduce time used on encoding and decoding, but would risk of loosing Java's optimization on strings (e.g., small string pool). To convert a Java `String` into `byte[]`, you may:

[source,java]
----
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

class Demo{
    static byte[] demo(){
        return "AGCT".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    }
}
----

Although parameters of the majority of methods are marked `final`, it may still be mutable. For example, the following operation is valid in Java:

[source,java]
----
class Demo{
    static void demo(){
        final int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
        arr[2] = 4;
        System.out.println(arr[2]);
        // Should give 4 as output.
    }
}
----

This makes the immutability of any passing `final byte[]` best-effort. If you're using `yStr` under a multi-threaded environment, you may protect your strings using mutex. On the contrary, `final String` completely immutable and considered safe.
