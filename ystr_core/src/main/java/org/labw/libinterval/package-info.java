/**
 * Intervals and interval-related algorithms and data structures.

 * @apiNote All intervals are assumed to be:
 *     <ol>
 *       <li>open-close {@code [)} -- i.e., including the start but not the end.
 *       <li>Zero-based, which is the default in Java, Python, and C++.
 *       <li>Immutable, which would allow functional programming supported by Java 8 and above
 *           without errors and easy parallelization.
 *     </ol>
